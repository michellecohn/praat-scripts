# Stimuli development: given a force aligned file (with a TextGrid) (e.g., via FAVE Align, DARLA, etc.), 
# find the silences between stimuli ("sp") and use that to extract sentences into separate soundfiles. 
#
# Adds a new tier on 3 ("Sentence"); finds "sp" and adds a boundary on the sentence tier. 
# Labels each sentence with a number (corresponding to the SPIN numbers); extracts all sentences
# Saves the sentences to an output folder 
#
# Includes a step where you can clean up any errant "sp"s in the textgrid 
#
#  NEED: to open soundfile and associated textgrid in Praat objects window

############ (1) Define filenames & output directory
speaker_name$ = "Salli"
condition$ = "Regular"

curr_soundfile$ = "Sound SPIN_'speaker_name$'"
curr_textgrid$ = "TextGrid SPIN_'speaker_name$'"
output_dir$ = "/Users/michellecohn/output/


############ (2) Create third tier in textgrid
selectObject: "'curr_textgrid$'"
Insert interval tier: 3, "Sentence"


############ (3) Find all "sp"s, looping through; 

selectObject: "'curr_textgrid$'"
segment_tier = 1
number_of_intervals = Get number of intervals... segment_tier
				

 	for i from 1 to number_of_intervals
		selectObject: "'curr_textgrid$'"
		interval_label$ = Get label of interval... segment_tier 'i'

		if interval_label$ = "sp"
			
			############ Get start and end time; calculate dur and divide by 2; 
			############ and add to "start time" 
 
			begin_sp = Get starting point... segment_tier 'i'
           	end_sp = Get end point... segment_tier 'i'
			start_sp = begin_sp
			Insert boundary... 3 'start_sp'
					
			
		endif
	endfor 


############ (4) Add sentence labels on 3rd tier 

selectObject: "'curr_textgrid$'"
sentence_tier = 3
number_of_intervals = Get number of intervals... sentence_tier



########## (5) Visually inspect tier 3 (can just open TextGrid and zoom out to see where extra boundaries are; counter on the 
########## right bottom side (e.g., 87/107) will show how many total sentences there are ... delete any boundaries

	beginPause: "Correct soundfile: 'extra_boundaries'"

	#Edit
	endPause: "Continue", 1



counter = 0
selectObject: "'curr_textgrid$'"

number_of_intervals = Get number of intervals... sentence_tier

 	for i from 1 to number_of_intervals
		counter = counter + 1
		Set interval text: sentence_tier, counter, "'counter'"
	endfor



########### (6) Extract all items from tier 3 
selectObject: "'curr_textgrid$'"
plusObject: "'curr_soundfile$'"
Extract all intervals... sentence_tier 0



############ (7) Rename sentences & save to folder
select all
minusObject: "'curr_textgrid$'"
minusObject: "'curr_soundfile$'"

n = numberOfSelected("Sound")
n= n+ 1
for icounter from 1 to n
    curr_sound_index = selected("Sound",'icounter')
	select curr_sound_index
	name$ = selected$ ("Sound")
    Write to WAV file... 'output_dir$'Sentence_'name$'_'speaker_name$'_'condition$'.wav

	select all

endfor


select all
Remove
